 Three user stories that describe how a user will interact with my site:

1/As an owner of the restaurant, I want to build a About My Restaurant page, so that my customers could know more about my business.
2/As a customer, I want to go to Menu Page to see what the merchant sells, so that I can decide what I would like to buy.
3/As a customer, I want to go to Reservation Page so that I can reserve a table as my wish.
